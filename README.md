Code and documentation associated to the article 'On the cohomology groups of real Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau threefolds' by H. Arg√ºz and T. Prince.

The source files contained in this repository are associated with the following results and computations. Magma source files can be tested online at 'http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/'. 

'course_cover_computations.m' assembles the Cech cohomology computations described in Theorems 6.3 and 7.1. This script loads:
  1) 'setup_cover.m', which encodes the 7-to-1 cover described in Section 4, and various monodromy matrices.
  2) 'coarse_cech_1_Z_functions.m' and 'course_cech_1_Z.m', which compute the Cech cohomology groups E^{i,1}_2 for i in {0,1} which appear in the statement of Theorem 7.1.
  3) 'coarse_cech_0_1.m' and 'coarse_cech_0_2.m', which compute the Cech cohomology groups E^{i,0}_2 for i in {1,2,3} which appear in the statements of Theorems 6.3 and 7.1.
  
'Heegaard_splitting.m' contains the computation described in Section 7.2, confirming the calculation of the groups E^{i,0}_2 which appear in the statements of Theorems 6.3 and 7.1.

'sq_for_smooth' contains the SageMath script for computing the Square map for toric Fano fourfolds. This is used to construct Table 1 in Section 6.

The file 'documentation.pdf' describes the computations made 'coarse_cech_1_Z_functions.m' and 'course_cech_1_Z.m'.
